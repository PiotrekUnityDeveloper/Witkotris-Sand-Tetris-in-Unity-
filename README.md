<hr>

broken as fuck but the main mechanic works

android 12+ older versions may not work

also note my coding skills are shit so it will lag on slower devices

works well on my friend's galaxy s22 ultra, and ive got something that runs android 5 so well fuck me

anyways enjoy, use the code as you want (though youre probably better of making your own from scratch)

but even if you dont, dont credit me or whatever. i want nothing to do with it

also its name comes from my friend. its his name and tetris bundled together (witek + tetris)

we enjoyed playing the original sand tetris game, and i loved those times, so i named it that

the original wasnt released on android, so i decided to test my skills and all that

but i suck as always haha

kill me
